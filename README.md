# Glance
As part of Udacity's Front-end web development nano degree program', I've implemented Glance. It is a simple application. It takes users' input and asynchronously fetches the most related image from Unsplash API and all related articles from the new york times API. I've used the XHR object to make AJAX calls in this application.
